This is because either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you paid National Insurance contributions at a lower rate</li>\n  <li>some of the National Insurance contributions you paid were used to contribute to a workplace or private pension</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>How much is taken off depends on how long you were contracted out and your earnings at the time.

You can read more detailed information about how this is calculated in <a href=\"/government/publications/your-new-state-pension-explained\">‘Your new State Pension explained’</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"examples-of-how-contracting-out-might-affect-you\">Examples of how contracting out might affect you</h3>\n\n<p>The amount of State Pension you’ll get will vary depending on how many years you were contracted out.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>Example 1</p>\n\n<p>Sam’s State Pension age is expected to be 67. They were contracted out which has reduced their estimated State Pension to £180 per week. This is less than the full rate of State Pension.</p>\n\n<p>Sam is still working and paying National Insurance which adds more qualifying years to their record. Each qualifying year they add is worth £5.82 per week. This means the £20 deduction will be cancelled out by adding 4 more qualifying years before they reach State Pension age.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>Example 2</p>\n\n<p>Jo is 60 years old and they have just stopped working. They were contracted out which reduced their forecast State Pension to £150 per week. They will reach State Pension age at 67.</p>\n\n<p>Jo could choose to pay 7 years of voluntary National Insurance contributions, to get qualifying years when they are not working. Each additional qualifying year will increase their amount by £5.82 per week, but Jo will not reach the full rate of new State Pension.</p>\n</div>\n\n",
