  "details": {
    "body": "<p>The early years foundation stage (<abbr title=\"Early years foundation stage\">EYFS</abbr>) sets standards for the learning, development and care of your child from birth to 5 years old.</p>\n\n<p>All schools and Ofsted-registered early years providers must follow the <abbr title=\"Early years foundation stage\">EYFS</abbr>, including childminders, preschools, nurseries and school reception classes.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>The EYFS only applies to schools and early years providers in England. There are different <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.gov.scot/Topics/People/Young-People/early-years/delivery/framework\">early years standards in Scotland</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://gov.wales/topics/educationandskills/earlyyearshome/foundation-phase/?lang=en\">early years standards in Wales</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"areas-of-learning\">Areas of learning</h2>\n\n<p>Your child will mostly be taught through games and play.</p>\n\n<p>The areas of learning are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>communication and language</li>\n  <li>personal, social and emotional development</li>\n  <li>physical development</li>\n  <li>literacy</li>\n  <li>mathematics</li>\n  <li>understanding the world</li>\n  <li>expressive arts and design</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"assessments\">Assessments</h2>\n\n<p>Your child’s progress will be reviewed when they’re between 2 and 3 by an early years practitioner or health visitor.</p>\n\n<p>Their class teacher will assess them at the end of the school year when they turn 5.</p>\n\n<p>The assessment is based on classroom observation - your child will not be tested. It uses the early learning goals, which can be found in the <a href=\"/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2\">early years framework</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-an-area-of-learning-conflicts-with-your-beliefs\">If an area of learning conflicts with your beliefs</h2>\n\n<p>Talk to your child’s early years provider if you think one or more areas of the <abbr title=\"Early years foundation stage\">EYFS</abbr> conflict with your religious or philosophical beliefs. They’ll tell you if you need to ask for an ‘exemption’.</p>\n\n<p>If you get an exemption, your child will not have to take part in a specific area of learning for 12 months.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ask-for-an-exemption\">Ask for an exemption</h3>\n\n<p>Write to your early years provider if you decide to ask for an exemption. You must explain how your religious or philosophical beliefs conflict with:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>an area of learning</li>\n  <li>a learning goal or assessment</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your early years provider will decide if you can get an exemption. If you get one, you’ll need to apply again after 12 months.</p>\n\n",
