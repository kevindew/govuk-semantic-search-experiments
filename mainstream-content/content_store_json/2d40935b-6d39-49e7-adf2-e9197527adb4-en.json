It’s also called ‘settlement’. It gives you the right to live, work and study here for as long as you like, and apply for benefits if you’re eligible. You can use it to apply for British citizenship.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"eligibility\">Eligibility</h2>\n\n<p>You must:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>have lived and worked in the UK for 5 years - there are rules for what <a href=\"/indefinite-leave-to-remain-scale-up-worker-visa/time-uk\">counts towards your time in the UK</a>\n</li>\n  <li>meet the <a href=\"/indefinite-leave-to-remain-scale-up-worker-visa/financial-requirements\">financial  requirements</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you’re not eligible using your Scale-up Worker visa, there are <a href=\"/indefinite-leave-to-remain\">other ways to apply for indefinite leave to remain</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"knowledge-of-language-and-life-in-the-uk\">Knowledge of language and life in the UK</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re 18 to 64 you’ll need to <a href=\"/life-in-the-uk-test\">book and pass the Life in the UK Test</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You do not need to prove you meet the English language requirements when you apply to settle using your Scale-up Worker visa.

Check which visas <a href=\"/indefinite-leave-to-remain-scale-up-worker-visa/time-uk\">count towards your time in the UK</a>. Your application may be refused if you apply earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Do not wait until your current visa expires.
