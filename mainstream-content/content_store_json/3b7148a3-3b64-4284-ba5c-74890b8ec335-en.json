It does not matter if you pleaded guilty or not guilty.</p>\n\n<p>Before you can appeal a conviction or sentence, you must apply for permission to appeal to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/courts-tribunals/court-of-appeal-criminal-division\">Court of Appeal Criminal Division</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Talk to your legal representative (if you have one) or get help from a <a href=\"/find-a-legal-adviser\">legal adviser</a> before you apply. They can help you decide if your application is likely to be successful or not.</p>\n\n<p>You do not need a legal representative to apply to appeal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ask-for-permission-to-appeal\">Ask for permission to appeal</h2>\n\n<p>Complete the relevant form to either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/government/publications/criminal-appeal-office-form-ng-conviction\">appeal your conviction</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/government/publications/criminal-appeal-office-form-ng-sentence\">appeal your sentence</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>If you’re applying without legal representation, complete the <a href=\"/government/publications/criminal-appeal-office-form-ng-conviction-easy-read\">easy read form for convictions</a> or the <a href=\"/government/publications/criminal-appeal-office-form-ng-sentence-easy-read\">easy read form for sentences</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Return the form by post or email. The return address is on the form.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in prison, you can ask a prison officer to send the form for you.</p>\n\n<p>You must apply within 28 days of either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the date you were convicted (even if you were sentenced at a later date) if you’re appealing against your conviction</li>\n  <li>the date you were sentenced if you’re appealing against your sentence</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you apply later you’ll need to explain why you could not send your application in on time. You may get an extension.</p>\n\n<p>A judge will look at your application and decide whether to give you permission.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-you-get-permission-to-appeal\">If you get permission to appeal</h2>\n\n<p>Your appeal will be heard by the Court of Appeal Criminal Division.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll get a letter before the hearing to let you know when and where it’ll take place.</p>\n\n<p>Your legal representative (for example, your barrister) will present your case to the judges.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re appealing a conviction, representatives from the prosecution will present the case against you. This will not always happen if you appeal against a sentence.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-you-do-not-get-permission-to-appeal\">If you do not get permission to appeal</h2>\n\n<p>You have the right to ask for permission to appeal a second time (known as ‘renewing your application’). The letter will tell you how to do this and include the relevant application form.</p>\n\n<p>A ‘full court’ of 2 or 3 judges will review your renewed application.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Warning\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>If your application is refused again, you may need to pay costs and you may be given a ‘loss of time order’. This means you will spend longer in custody and the time will be added to your sentence.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-you-win-your-appeal\">If you win your appeal</h2>\n\n<p>Your conviction may be overturned or your sentence may be reduced (or both).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-you-lose-your-appeal\">If you lose your appeal</h2>\n\n<p>Your original sentence or conviction will not change. You cannot appeal again.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ccrc.gov.uk/contact-us/\">Contact the Criminal Cases Review Commission (<abbr title=\"Criminal Cases Review Commission\">CCRC</abbr>)</a> if you think there’s been a ‘miscarriage of justice’, for example if evidence was not presented.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"stopping-your-appeal\">Stopping your appeal</h2>\n\n<p>You can apply to stop your appeal at any time.</p>\n\n<p>To do this, you must download and fill in a <a href=\"/government/publications/notice-abandoning-an-appeal\">notice of abandoning an appeal form</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Send your completed form to the Criminal Appeal Office.</p>\n\n<div class=\"address\"><div class=\"adr org fn\"><p>\n\nCustomer Service Officer  \n<br>Criminal Appeal Office  \n<br>Royal Courts of Justice  \n<br>Strand  \n<br>London   \n<br>WC2A 2LL   \n<br>\n</p></div></div>\n\n<p>You cannot usually restart your appeal once it’s been stopped.</p>\n\n",
