    "body": "<p>There are rules on how you can use common land and town and village greens.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"common-land\">Common land</h2>\n\n<p>Common land is owned, for example by a local council, privately or by the National Trust.</p>\n\n<p>You usually have the <a href=\"/right-of-way-open-access-land/use-your-right-to-roam\">right to roam</a> on it. This means you can use it for certain activities like walking and climbing.</p>\n\n<p>Some common land has different rights, so you may be able to use it for other activities, for example horse-riding.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>camp on common land without the owner’s permission</li>\n  <li>light a fire or have a barbecue</li>\n  <li>hold a festival or other event without permission</li>\n  <li>drive across it without permission unless you have the <a href=\"/guidance/common-land-and-town-or-village-greens-access-your-property-by-vehicle\">right to access your property</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"town-and-village-greens\">Town and village greens</h2>\n<p>You can use town and village greens for sports and recreation, for example playing football or walking your dog. Some also have ‘rights of common’ over them - like grazing livestock.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"/right-of-way-open-access-land/use-your-right-to-roam\">right to roam</a> does not apply.</p>\n\n<p>Many greens are owned and maintained by local parish or community councils. Some are privately owned.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"common-land-and-village-greens-near-you\">Common land and village greens near you</h2>\n<p>Find out where your local common land or village green is by contacting <a href=\"/find-your-local-park\">your local council.</a> It keeps the ‘Register of Common Land and Village Greens’ for your area.</p>\n\n<p>Each entry in the register includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a description of the land</li>\n  <li>who has rights to use it, and what those rights are</li>\n  <li>who owns it, or who owned it when it was first registered</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"have-your-say-on-changes-to-common-land\">Have your say on changes to common land</h2>\n\n<p>Planned changes to common land will be advertised in local newspapers and put on signs around the land.

This can be done:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>by the landowner</li>\n  <li>informally, by landowners and those with rights on the land working together, for example to keep the land maintained and not over- or under-grazed</li>\n  <li>formally, by setting up a statutory <a href=\"/guidance/set-up-a-commons-council\">commons council</a> - the stakeholders sit on the council and make decisions by voting; the decisions of the council are legally binding</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>Natural England has guidance on <a href=\"/guidance/managing-common-land\">managing common land</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n",
