Under the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/part/IV\">Children Act 1989</a> a council can apply for a care order if it believes a child is suffering or at risk of suffering significant harm.</p>\n\n<p>The court decides if the child can be taken into care.</p>\n\n<p>Care orders last until:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the child’s 18th birthday</li>\n  <li>an order is made giving parental responsibility to another person - for example, through adoption or special guardianship</li>\n  <li>the court lifts the order (this is called ‘discharging’ the order)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>A child can only be taken into care if they are under 18.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"making-a-complaint\">Making a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>If your child is in care and you’re unhappy about their treatment, you can make a complaint.
