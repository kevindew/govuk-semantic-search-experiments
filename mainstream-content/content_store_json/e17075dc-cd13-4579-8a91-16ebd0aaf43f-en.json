For example, if you sell your house to your child for less than its market value, the difference in value counts as a gift.</p>\n\n<p>​​Anything you leave in your will does not count as a gift but is part of your estate. Your estate is all your money, property and possessions left when you die. The <a href=\"/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died/estimate-estate-value\">value of your estate</a> will be used to work out if Inheritance Tax needs to be paid.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"who-does-not-pay-inheritance-tax\">Who does not pay Inheritance Tax</h2>\n\n<p>Some gifts are exempt from Inheritance Tax.</p>\n\n<p>There’s no Inheritance Tax to pay on gifts between spouses or civil partners. You can give them as much as you like during your lifetime, as long as they:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>live in the UK permanently</li>\n  <li>are legally married or in a civil partnership with you</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There’s also no Inheritance Tax to pay on any gifts you give to charities or political parties.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"using-allowances-to-give-tax-free-gifts\">Using allowances to give tax free gifts</h2>\n\n<p>Each tax year, you can also give away some money or possessions free of Inheritance Tax. How much is tax free depends on which allowances you use.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"annual-exemption\">Annual exemption</h3>\n\n<p>You can give away a total of £3,000 worth of gifts each tax year without them being added to the value of your estate. This is known as your ‘annual exemption’.</p>\n\n<p>You can give gifts or money up to £3,000 to one person or split the £3,000 between several people.</p>\n\n<p>You can carry any unused annual exemption forward to the next tax year - but only for one tax year.</p>\n\n<p>The tax year runs from 6 April to 5 April the following year.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<h3 id=\"example\">Example</h3>\n\n<p>In the 2021 to 2022 tax year, Mark gave £2,000 to his daughter Jane. If he died within 7 years of the gift, this would use £2,000 of his annual exemption.</p>\n\n<p>In the following 2022 to 2023 tax year, Mark gave £4,000 to his other daughter Sarah. If Mark died within 7 years of the gift, this would use his annual exemption of £3,000 plus the £1,000 of annual exemption left over from the previous tax year.</p>\n\n<p>Even if Mark dies within 7 years of giving these gifts, there’s no Inheritance Tax to pay.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"small-gift-allowance\">Small gift allowance</h3>\n\n<p>You can give as many gifts of up to £250 per person as you want each tax year, as long as you have not used another allowance on the same person.</p>\n\n<p>Birthday or Christmas gifts you give from your regular income are exempt from Inheritance Tax.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gifts-for-weddings-or-civil-partnerships\">Gifts for weddings or civil partnerships</h3>\n\n<p>Each tax year, you can give a tax free gift to someone who is getting married or starting a civil partnership. You can give up to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>£5,000 to a child</li>\n  <li>£2,500 to a grandchild or great-grandchild</li>\n  <li>£1,000 to any other person</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you’re giving gifts to the same person, you can combine a wedding gift allowance with any other allowance, except for the small gift allowance.</p>\n\n<p>For example, you can give your child a wedding gift of £5,000 as well as £3,000 using your annual exemption in the same tax year.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"if-you-make-regular-payments\">If you make regular payments</h3>\n\n<p>You can make regular payments to another person, for example to help with their living costs. There’s no limit to how much you can give tax free, as long as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you can afford the payments after meeting your usual living costs</li>\n  <li>you pay from your regular monthly income</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are known as ‘normal expenditure out of income’. They can include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>paying rent for your child</li>\n  <li>paying into a savings account for a child under 18</li>\n  <li>giving financial support to an elderly relative</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you’re giving gifts to the same person, you can combine ‘normal expenditure out of income’ with any other allowance, except for the small gift allowance.</p>\n\n<p>For example, you can give your child a regular payment of £60 a month (a total of £720 a year) as well as using your annual exemption of £3,000 in the same tax year.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-7-year-rule\">The 7 year rule</h2>\n\n<p>No tax is due on any gifts you give if you live for 7 years after giving them - unless the gift is <a href=\"/guidance/trusts-and-inheritance-tax\">part of a trust</a>. This is known as the 7 year rule.</p>\n\n<p>If you die within 7 years of giving a gift and there’s Inheritance Tax to pay on it, the amount of tax due after your death depends on when you gave it.</p>\n\n<p>Gifts given in the 3 years before your death are taxed at 40%.</p>\n\n<p>Gifts given 3 to 7 years before your death are taxed on a sliding scale known as ‘taper relief’.</p>\n\n<p>Taper relief only applies if the total value of gifts made in the 7 years before you die is over the £325,000 tax-free threshold.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taper-relief\">Taper relief</h3>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"col\">Years between gift and death</th>\n      <th scope=\"col\">Rate of tax on the gift</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">3 to 4 years</th>\n      <td>32%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">4 to 5 years</th>\n      <td>24%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">5 to 6 years</th>\n      <td>16%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">6 to 7 years</th>\n      <td>8%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th scope=\"row\">7 or more</th>\n      <td>0%</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2 id=\"giving-gifts-you-still-benefit-from\">Giving gifts you still benefit from</h2>\n\n<p>If you give something away but still benefit from it (a ‘gift with reservation’), it will count towards the <a href=\"/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died/estimate-estate-value\">value of your estate</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Gifts with reservation include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>giving your home to a relative but still living there</li>\n  <li>giving away a caravan but still using it for free for your holidays</li>\n  <li>giving away a valuable painting but still displaying it in your house</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Read further guidance on when a gift with reservation <a href=\"/guidance/work-out-inheritance-tax-due-on-gifts\">counts towards the estate’s value</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"keeping-records-of-gifts-youve-given\">Keeping records of gifts you’ve given</h2>\n\n<p>The person who deals with your estate will need to work out what gifts you gave in the 7 years before your death. You should keep the following records:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>what you gave and who you gave it to</li>\n  <li>the value of the gift</li>\n  <li>when you gave it</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-inheritance-tax-on-a-gift-is-paid\">How Inheritance Tax on a gift is paid</h2>\n\n<p>Any Inheritance Tax due on gifts is usually paid by the estate, unless you give away more than £325,000 in gifts in the 7 years before your death. Once you’ve given away more than £325,000, anyone who gets a gift from you in those 7 years will have to pay Inheritance Tax on their gift.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<h3 id=\"example\">Example</h3>\n\n<p>Sally died on 1 July 2022.
