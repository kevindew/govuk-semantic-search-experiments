It’s a great way to meet your neighbours, celebrate national or local events, or just say thanks to someone in your area.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-get-involved\">How can I get involved?</h2>\n<p>You don’t need to fill in complicated forms to ask for a street closure to have a street party.</p>\n\n<p>All your council needs to know is where and when the closure will take place so they can plan around this (for example, so that the emergency services know).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-hold-street-party\" class=\"govuk-link\">Enter your postcode here</a> to find out how to apply to hold a street party in your area.</p>\n\n<p>Your council shouldn’t charge you for a road closure - if your council tries to charge you for this, you can challenge them about it.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t want to close the road, or you can’t close it (for example, if you live on a main road), you could consider organising a ‘Street Meet’ on private land instead, such as a driveway or garden.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-insurance\">Licences and insurance</h3>\n\n<p>You don’t need a licence for food, alcohol or entertainment unless you’re planning to charge or open your event to the general public.</p>\n\n<p>You also don’t need to have public liability insurance. If your council insists on it you can challenge them about this.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/your-guide-to-organising-a-street-party\" class=\"govuk-link\">Read the step-by-step guide</a> for more information about organising your street party.</p>\n</div>",
