This means assistive technologies will not read the tables correctly. This fails <abbr title=\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships).</li>\n  <li>Images on some pages do not always have suitable image descriptions.

This fails <abbr title=\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (Non-text Content).</li>\n  <li>Some pages have duplicate titles. This may make it difficult for users to orient themselves and find the right content. This fails <abbr title=\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\">WCAG</abbr> 2.4.2 success criterion (Page Titled).</li>\n  <li>The change in the default written language is not correctly identified on some pages. This means screen readers will not read content correctly. This fails <abbr title=\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 success criterion 3.1.2 (Language of Parts).</li>\n  <li>Translation Navigation is inconsistently named. This fails <abbr title=\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 success criterion 3.2.4 (Consistent Identification).</li>\n  <li>Some pages cannot be found through more than one type of navigation.

This fails <abbr title=\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 success criterion 3.2.4 success criterion (Consistent Identification).</li>\n  <li>Some content looks like headings but is not. This makes it difficult for screen reader users to navigate the page. This fails <abbr title=\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships).</li>\n  <li>Some pages have poor colour contrast. This fails <abbr title=\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 success criterion 1.4.1 (Use of Colour).</li>\n  <li>Many documents are in less accessible formats, for example <abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr>.

For example, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/temporary-events-notice\">applying for a Temporary Events Notice</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>adjacent links to the same pages mean it’s not easy to navigate using keyboard alone - this fails <abbr title=\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 success criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard)</li>\n  <li>some forms controls are not detectable by screen reader software - this fails <abbr title=\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value)</li>\n  <li>some pages are missing a heading - this fails <abbr title=\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\">WCAG</abbr> 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The non-accessible content used to apply for some types of licence is published through platforms which we are transitioning to new arrangements.
