        "body": "<p>You <a href=\"/apply-for-council-housing\">apply for council housing</a> through your local council.</p>\n\n<p>Each council has its own rules.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll usually have to join a waiting list and you’re not guaranteed to get a property. Ask your council how long you’re likely to have to wait.</p>\n\n<p>You can apply if you’re 18 or over (some councils let you apply if you’re 16 or over).</p>\n\n<p>You may be able to apply even if you do not live in the area.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"waiting-lists\">Waiting lists</h2>\n<p>Councils decide who gets offered housing based on a ‘points’ or ‘banding’ system.</p>\n\n<p>Points and bands are based on housing need. For example, you’re likely to be offered housing first if you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>are homeless</li>\n  <li>live in cramped conditions</li>\n  <li>have a medical condition made worse by your current home</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Once you’re high enough on the list, your council will contact you about an available property.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"choice-based-lettings\">Choice-based lettings</h2>\n<p>Some councils have a choice-based letting scheme. This lets you tell your council which properties you’re interested in. It depends on the council, but once you’ve been accepted onto the waiting list, the basic steps are:</p>\n\n<ol class=\"steps\">\n<li>\n<p>Find a property: check in local papers, on council websites, in council offices or in local libraries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check you can apply for it: some properties are only suitable for single people, families or disabled people.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Apply: this is known as ‘bidding’, but it does not involve money. You can bid online, by phone or by text.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Get the council’s decision.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"getting-an-offer\">Getting an offer</h2>\n<p>Normally you only have a short time to accept a housing offer. If you do not accept it, you can usually stay on the waiting list (or bid for other properties), but you may be put lower down the list.</p>\n\n<p>You may be taken off the list temporarily if you keep rejecting offers.</p>\n\n<p>You can appeal if you’re not happy with your council’s decision.</p>\n",

These give you different rights and responsibilities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"introductory-tenancy\">Introductory tenancy</h2>\n<p>New council tenants may be offered an introductory tenancy. These usually last 12 months and are like a ‘trial’ period.</p>\n\n<p>You automatically become a secure or flexible tenant after 12 months, unless your council has either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>started action to evict you</li>\n  <li>extended your introductory tenancy for a further 6 months</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are limits to what you can do with an introductory tenancy, for example you cannot:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>make major improvements to the property</li>\n  <li>swap your property with another council tenant</li>\n  <li>apply to buy your property through the <a href=\"/right-to-buy-buying-your-council-home\">Right to Buy scheme</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"secure-tenancy\">Secure tenancy</h2>\n<p>As a secure tenant, you can normally live in the property for the rest of your life, as long as you do not break the conditions of the tenancy.</p>\n\n<p>You can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>rent out rooms - but you cannot sub-let the whole property</li>\n  <li>buy your property through the <a href=\"/right-to-buy-buying-your-council-home\">Right to Buy</a> scheme</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"/apply-swap-homes-council\">swap your home with another council or housing association tenant</a> - with your council’s permission</li>\n  <li>transfer your tenancy to someone else in some circumstances</li>\n  <li>make improvements to your home - you’ll need permission from your council for some types of work</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"scottish-secure-tenancy\">Scottish secure tenancy</h2>\n<p>You’ll usually have a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://scotland.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/advice_topics/renting_rights/council_housing_association_and_housing_co-op_tenancies/your_rights_as_a_scottish_secure_tenant\">Scottish secure tenancy</a> if you rent your home from the council, a housing association or housing co-operative in Scotland.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"flexible-tenancy\">Flexible tenancy</h2>\n\n<p>As a flexible tenant, you have tenancy for a fixed period. This is usually for at least 5 years, though in some cases it may be between 2 and 5 years.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the fixed period the council may decide to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>offer you another fixed-term tenancy</li>\n  <li>offer you a secure tenancy</li>\n  <li>not renew your tenancy</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>They must explain their reasons if they decide not to renew your tenancy and give you a chance to challenge the decision.</p>\n\n<p>As a flexible tenant you can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>rent out rooms - but you cannot sub-let the whole property</li>\n  <li>buy your property through the <a href=\"/right-to-buy-buying-your-council-home\">Right to Buy</a> scheme</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"/apply-swap-homes-council\">swap your home with another council or housing association tenant</a> - with your council’s permission</li>\n  <li>transfer your tenancy to someone else in some circumstances</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"joint-tenancy\">Joint tenancy</h2>\n<p>Under a joint tenancy, all the tenants share equal responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>You can apply for a joint tenancy at any time if you’re married or in a registered civil partnership. You must usually have lived together at the property for at least 12 months if you’re a cohabiting couple or related (like brother and sister).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transferring-your-tenancy\">Transferring your tenancy</h2>\n<p>Secure and flexible tenants may be able to transfer a tenancy to someone else, or, in some circumstances, pass on a tenancy to someone when they die.</p>\n\n<p>Secure tenancies granted before 1 April 2012 can be transferred or passed on only once. For example, if you take over a tenancy when someone dies, you cannot pass on the tenancy to someone else when you die.</p>\n\n<p>Some secure and flexible tenancies granted from 1 April 2012 may mean you can transfer or pass on your tenancy more than once - check your tenancy agreement.</p>\n\n<p>To transfer a tenancy, complete a ‘request to assign tenancy’ form, available from your <a href=\"/find-local-council\">local council’s housing department</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ending-your-tenancy\">Ending your tenancy</h2>\n<p>Your tenancy can only be ended if:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you give the council 4 weeks’ notice in writing</li>\n  <li>the council <a href=\"/council-housing-association-evictions\">evicts</a> you</li>\n  <li>the council needs to move you, for example to redevelop the property - it should offer you a new property and a new tenancy with no less security</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Secure tenancies can also end if:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the council needs to move you, for example to redevelop your property – it should offer you a new property and a new secure tenancy</li>\n  <li>you transfer your tenancy to someone else or <a href=\"/apply-swap-homes-council\">swap homes</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"ending-joint-tenancies\">Ending joint tenancies</h3>\n<p>If only one of you wants to end the tenancy and the other joint tenant(s) wants to stay in the property, your council may:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>give the remaining tenant(s) a new tenancy at the same property</li>\n  <li>not give them a new tenancy, for example because the property could be offered to another couple or family</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If one joint tenant dies, the tenancy continues for the surviving tenant(s).</p>\n\n<p>If you and your partner divorce or your relationship breaks down and you cannot agree on who gets the tenancy, a court can decide this.</p>\n",
