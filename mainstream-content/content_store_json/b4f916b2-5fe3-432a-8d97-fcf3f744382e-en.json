If they’re successful, you’ll still own the building but they’ll manage it.</p>\n\n<p>This means they’ll be responsible for things like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>collecting and managing the service charge</li>\n  <li>upkeep of communal areas (such as communal hallways and stairs)</li>\n  <li>upkeep of the structure of the building (such as the roof)</li>\n  <li>dealing with complaints about the building from other leaseholders</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>Qualifying leaseholders can use the Right to Manage for any reason - they don’t have to prove the building has been badly managed.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"right-to-manage-companies\">Right to Manage companies</h2>\n<p>To use the right, leaseholders must set up an <abbr title=\"Right to Manage\">RTM</abbr> company and follow certain procedures. The <abbr title=\"Right to Manage\">RTM</abbr> company can manage the building directly, or pay a managing agent to do it.</p>\n\n<p>As landlord, you have the right to be a member of the <abbr title=\"Right to Manage\">RTM</abbr> company and to vote on decisions. You get at least 1 vote. How many votes you’ll get depends on how many flats you own in the building.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nThere are 20 flats in the block. 16 are owned by leaseholders. 4 are owned by you and rented out on assured shorthold tenancies. You get 4 votes - 1 for each of the flats you own and rent out.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Right to Manage\">RTM</abbr> company must pay for any costs you incur during the management transfer process - even if it doesn’t end up managing the building.</p>\n\n",
