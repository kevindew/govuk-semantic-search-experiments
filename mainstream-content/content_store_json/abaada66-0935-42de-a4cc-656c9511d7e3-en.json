This might not be you.</p>\n\n<p>It will usually be the people best placed to protect the child, such as the child’s parent, guardian or carer.</p>\n\n<p>The police will normally tell the person who was checked that they’re sharing this information, if they decide it’s safe to do that. This might include telling the person that you asked for the check. The police will talk to you when making this decision.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"if-the-police-want-to-share-information-with-you\">If the police want to share information with you</h3>\n\n<p>The police will only share information with you if you sign an agreement promising not to tell anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>If you think there are other people who should be told, ask the police about this.</p>\n",
