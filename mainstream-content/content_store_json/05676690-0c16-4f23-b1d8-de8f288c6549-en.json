For example, there are different tax point rules for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>certain trades - like barristers, building and construction</li>\n  <li>where the supply is not a ‘sale’ – for example business items taken for personal use</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sometimes, one sale can give rise to 2 or more tax points - for example, where the customer pays a deposit in advance, and then a final payment.</p>\n\n",
