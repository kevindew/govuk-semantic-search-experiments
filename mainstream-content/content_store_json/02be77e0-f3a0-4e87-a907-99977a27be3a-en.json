Your employer cannot refuse.</p>\n\n<p>However, they do not have to contribute if you earn these amounts or less:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>£520 a month</li>\n  <li>£120 a week</li>\n  <li>£480 over 4 weeks</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When you’re enrolled into their pension scheme, your employer must:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>pay <a href=\"/workplace-pensions/what-you-your-employer-and-the-government-pay\">at least the minimum contributions</a> to the pension scheme on time - usually by 22nd of each month</li>\n  <li>let you <a href=\"/workplace-pensions/if-you-want-to-leave-your-workplace-pension-scheme\">leave the pension scheme</a> (called ‘opting out’) if you ask - and refund money you’ve paid if you opt out within 1 month</li>\n  <li>let you rejoin the scheme at least once a year if you’ve opted out</li>\n  <li>enrol you back in at least every 3 years if you’ve opted out and you’re still eligible for automatic enrolment</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-your-employer-cannot-do\">What your employer cannot do</h2>\n\n<p>Your employer cannot:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>encourage or force you to opt out of the scheme</li>\n  <li>unfairly dismiss or discriminate against you for staying in a workplace pension scheme</li>\n  <li>imply someone’s more likely to get a job if they choose to opt out of the pension scheme</li>\n  <li>close a workplace pension scheme without automatically enrolling all members into another one</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>If you’re concerned about the way your employer is dealing with automatic enrolment or managing your workplace pension, you can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/contact-us/scheme-members-who-to-contact/report-concerns-about-your-workplace-pension\">contact The Pensions Regulator.</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-your-employer-must-tell-you\">What your employer must tell you</h2>\n\n<p>When your employer automatically enrols you into their workplace pension scheme, they must write to you.

In some cases, this will mean you and your employer pay less tax and National Insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Ask your employer if they use salary sacrifice.</p>\n",
