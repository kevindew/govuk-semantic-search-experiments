It must tell all members entitled to vote and the employer what the ballot results were.</p>\n\n<p>A trade union calls industrial action by telling members and the employer when and how this action will be taken. This should be done by a trade union official or committee that has the legal right to do so. Your voting paper must have said who this is.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"taking-part-in-industrial-action---your-rights\">Taking part in industrial action - your rights</h2>\n<p>If you’re a trade union member, you have the right to vote before your union asks you to take industrial action.
