The ways you can do this include contacting their:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>relatives (including children)</li>\n  <li>friends</li>\n  <li>last known employer</li>\n  <li>trade union or professional organisation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Fill in the <a href=\"/divorce/file-for-divorce\">divorce petition</a> or <a href=\"/end-civil-partnership/apply\">dissolution application</a> with their current, or last known, address.

You’ll need to try another way to send it to your partner. You can either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"/government/publications/form-d11-application-notice\">apply for the petition or application to be sent in another way</a>, for example by email</li>\n  <li>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.find-court-tribunal.service.gov.uk/courts/divorce-service-centre\">contact the Divorce Service Centre</a> to apply for a search of other government departments to get their address</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You’ll have to pay a £53 court fee for each.</p>\n\n<p>If you still cannot find them, you’ll have to fill in the <a href=\"/government/publications/form-d13b-statement-in-support-to-dispense-with-service-of-the-divorce-dissolution-nullity-judicial-separation-petition-on-the-respondent\">statement to dispense with service of petition or application</a>. Return the statement to your regional divorce centre. You’ll have to pay a £53 court fee.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-theyre-presumed-dead\">If they’re presumed dead</h2>\n\n<p>If you have sufficient evidence that your partner has died, then you can fill in a <a href=\"/government/publications/form-d8d-petition-for-a-presumption-of-death-decreeorder-and-the-dissolution-of-a-marriagecivil-partnership\">petition for the presumption of death</a> without sending a divorce petition or dissolution application.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll have to pay a £365 court fee.</p>\n\n<p>You can use a solicitor to advise you on what evidence you need to provide. <a href=\"/find-a-legal-adviser\">Find a solicitor</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can use the presumption of death petition to remarry or form a new civil partnership, but not to get a death certificate, financial order (‘ancillary relief’) or apply for probate.</p>\n",
