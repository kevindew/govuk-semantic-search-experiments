You’d need to slow down, so it’s now a developing hazard.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h4 id=\"how-the-scoring-works\">How the scoring works</h4>\n<p>You can score up to 5 points for each developing hazard.</p>\n\n<p>To get a high score, click the mouse as soon as you see the hazard starting to develop.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Warning\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>You do not lose points if you click and get it wrong. However, you will not score anything if you click continuously or in a pattern.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>You only get one attempt at each clip.
