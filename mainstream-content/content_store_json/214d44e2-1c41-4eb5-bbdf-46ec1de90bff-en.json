You must delete the data as soon as we no longer need it or no later than 1 month after the vulnerability has been resolved - whichever comes first.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"after-youve-reported-the-vulnerability\">After you’ve reported the vulnerability</h2>\n\n<p>You’ll get updates on the progress fixing the vulnerability through HackerOne, if you have an account.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll get confirmation that we have received your report within 5 working days. We’ll try to assess your report within 10 working days. We prioritise fixes by impact, severity and exploit complexity.</p>\n\n<p>Once the vulnerability has been fixed, we can work with you to disclose and publish the report.</p>\n\n",
