    "body": "<p>You must go through security every time you enter a court or tribunal building.</p>\n\n<p>Allow extra time to go through security. You may have to queue between 9am and 10am on weekdays.</p>\n\n<p>There are rules on what items you can take in.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"items-youre-not-allowed-to-take-in\">Items you’re not allowed to take in</h2>\n\n<p>You cannot take guns, firearms, knives or other weapons into the building.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Warning\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>You’ll be reported to the police if you try to take a weapon into a court or tribunal building.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>You also cannot take in items that security staff think could be used as a weapon, even if you think they’re harmless.</p>\n\n<p>These include things like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>blades - such as scissors, penknives and razors</li>\n  <li>other sharp items - such as knitting needles and darts</li>\n  <li>glass - for example bottles</li>\n  <li>metal cutlery</li>\n  <li>syringes (unless you have a prescription)</li>\n  <li>toy guns and other things that look like guns</li>\n  <li>tools - for example screwdrivers, hammers and nails</li>\n  <li>ropes and chains</li>\n  <li>alcohol</li>\n  <li>liquids that are not drinks or prescription medicine - such as oils, perfumes lighter refills and cleaning products</li>\n  <li>full-length umbrellas</li>\n  <li>crash helmets</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"items-you-can-take-in\">Items you can take in</h2>\n\n<p>You can take in phones and cameras, but you must not take photos or make videos with them.</p>\n\n<p>You can bring in hand sanitiser. You will be asked to use it in front of security staff to prove it’s not harmful.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drinks\">Drinks</h3>\n\n<p>You can take in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>unopened drinks in cartons and cans</li>\n  <li>drinks in a bottle, flask or cup with a lid - these cannot be made of glass</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>If your drink is opened, or in a bottle, flask or cup, you’ll be asked to drink some to prove it’s not harmful.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"medicines\">Medicines</h3>\n\n<p>You can take in prescription medicines. They must have the pharmacist label with your name and the date they were issued.</p>\n\n<p>Security staff will check the label. They will not record or share the information. Find out <a href=\"/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service/about/personal-information-charter\">how your personal information is used</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"going-through-security\">Going through security</h2>\n\n<p>You’ll go through a security check, like you would at an airport. This may include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>emptying your pockets into a tray</li>\n  <li>taking off your shoes, coat, gloves or hat</li>\n  <li>being asked to take off or open your belt</li>\n  <li>walking through an archway detector</li>\n  <li>being checked by hand or with a handheld scanner</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>If you’re wearing a head covering for religious or cultural reasons, you can ask for it to be checked with a handheld scanner so you do not have to take it off.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-you-cannot-take-your-items-in-with-you\">If you cannot take your items in with you</h2>\n\n<p>Security staff will keep any items you cannot take into the building and give you a receipt. You can usually use this to collect your items when you leave.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"knives\">Knives</h3>\n\n<p>If <a href=\"/buying-carrying-knives\">you have a knife</a>, you will not be able to collect this when you leave. You’ll need to write to the court within 28 days instead. The letter must include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>your first and last name</li>\n  <li>your address</li>\n  <li>the date and time the knife was taken by security</li>\n  <li>a description of the knife</li>\n  <li>your receipt number</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You’ll usually get your items back within a month after the court receives your letter.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>Someone acting on your behalf can write the letter for you, such as your solicitor or guardian. They should include their name and address when they send it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-you-have-to-visit-a-custody-suite\">If you have to visit a custody suite</h2>\n\n<p>You need to hand in most electronic items like mobile phones, smart watches, tablets or memory sticks. You may be allowed to bring in a laptop and a laptop charger to access files.</p>\n\n<p>You may be randomly selected for a hand search.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"make-a-complaint\">Make a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service/about/complaints-procedure\">complain about how you were treated</a> if you’re unhappy about the way a security search was carried out.</p>\n",
