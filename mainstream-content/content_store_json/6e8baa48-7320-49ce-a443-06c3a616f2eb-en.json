Tell <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> you need help to claim benefits by calling the number of the benefit you’re applying for. If you’re eligible, they’ll arrange a support visit.</p>\n\n<p>You can also be referred for a support visit by a charitable organisation like Citizens Advice or Age UK.</p>\n\n<p>Support visits can take place somewhere other than your home, for example at a hospital. This will usually be discussed with you when you’re referred.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>This guide is also available <a href=\"/ymweliadau-cefnogol-wneud-cais-fudd-daliadau\">in Welsh (Cymraeg)</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"eligibility\">Eligibility</h2>\n\n<p>A visit can be arranged for you if you need extra help to claim benefits, for example because you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>have complex needs</li>\n  <li>are disabled</li>\n  <li>are a vulnerable young person making a claim for the first time</li>\n  <li>have nobody else to support you</li>\n  <li>cannot claim benefits in any other way</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> will also arrange a support visit if someone you know is <a href=\"/become-appointee-for-someone-claiming-benefits\">applying to become your appointee</a> to help you manage your benefits.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-to-expect\">What to expect</h2>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> Visiting Team will call you to book a visit and tell you what to expect, including how to contact them. You’ll get a letter to confirm the booking, but if the visit has been booked at short notice, it may happen before you get the letter.</p>\n\n<p>If the visit is going to take place at your home and you’ve given a mobile number, the team will also confirm the booking by text message.</p>\n\n<p>Before the visit, the <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> Visiting Team will tell you about:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the date and time of the visit - you can reschedule it if you need to</li>\n  <li>where the visit will take place</li>\n  <li>how to contact the Visiting Team</li>\n  <li>who will visit you - you’ll be given the visiting officer’s name</li>\n  <li>what identity documents you’ll need to show before the visit can begin</li>\n  <li>security and safety for the visit</li>\n  <li>what you’ll need to tell <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> about your income and savings</li>\n  <li>what you should tell <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> about your health</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The length of support visits varies and it’s not possible to say how long the visit will take.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"check-the-visit-is-genuine\">Check the visit is genuine</h2>\n\n<p>You can call the <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> Visiting Team before the visit if you have any questions, including if you want to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>reschedule your visit</li>\n  <li>change where you want the visit to take place</li>\n  <li>arrange for a password to be used between yourself and a visiting officer to check their identity</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The number will be on the letter and in the text message you got about the visit.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"check-the-identity-of-the-visiting-officer\">Check the identity of the visiting officer</h3>\n\n<p>The visiting officer will show you their photo identity card when they arrive.</p>\n\n<p>You can then check if the visiting officer named in the letter you got about the visit is the same person.</p>\n\n<p>If you cannot check their photo identity card (for example, if you have a visual impairment) you can agree on a password for the visiting officer to say when they arrive. You need to arrange this before the visit by calling the <abbr title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">DWP</abbr> Visiting Team.</p>\n\n<p>You can also check their identity by calling the number on the letter or in the text message, and giving the visiting officer’s name.</p>\n\n",
