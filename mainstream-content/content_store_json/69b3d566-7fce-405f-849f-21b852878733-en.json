Check with your childcare provider to find out if this is something they offer.</p>\n\n<p>The childcare:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>must be with an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/help-with-childcare-costs/what-counts-approved-childcare\">approved childcare provider</a>\n</li>\n  <li>stops when your child starts in reception class (or reaches compulsory school age, if later)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may have to pay for extra costs like meals, nappies or trips.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-you-need-to-apply\">What you need to apply</h2>\n\n<p>You’ll need your details (and your partner’s, if you have one), including your:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>National Insurance number</li>\n  <li>Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR), if you’re self-employed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You’ll also need:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the UK birth certificate reference number (if you have one) of any children you’re applying for</li>\n  <li>the date you started or are due to start work (this can be approximate if more than 3 months ago)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"if-youre-a-director\">If you’re a director</h3>\n\n<p>You’ll need to show you meet the <a href=\"/30-hours-free-childcare\">minimum income requirements</a> to be eligible.

This could be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>wage slips</li>\n  <li>bank statements</li>\n  <li>a statement from your accountant</li>\n  <li>copies of invoices</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you’re not paid regularly (for example, once a year) you may need to send other evidence to show you’ll meet the minimum income requirements, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>annual wage slips</li>\n  <li>year end payroll</li>\n  <li>a letter from your tax agent or adviser confirming your salary has been paid and taxed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You’ll need to do this the first time you apply, and every time you reconfirm your eligibility.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"if-you-have-a-partner\">If you have a partner</h3>\n\n<p>You must include your partner in your application if you are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>married or in a civil partnership and live together</li>\n  <li>not married or in a civil partnership, but living together as though you are</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Their employment and income will not affect your eligibility if they:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>are or will be absent from your household for more than 6 months</li>\n  <li>are a prisoner</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You and your partner cannot both have accounts for the same child.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"if-you-are-separated\">If you are separated</h3>\n\n<p>You and your ex-partner need to decide who should apply if you are jointly responsible for your child.</p>\n\n<p>If you cannot decide, both of you must apply separately and HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr>) will decide who gets a childcare account.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"apply-for-a-code\">Apply for a code</h2>\n\n<p>It usually takes 20 minutes to apply.
