This will ask you how your illness or disability affects your ability to complete everyday tasks.</p>\n\n<ol class=\"steps\">\n<li>\n<p>Complete this questionnaire and return it by the deadline. Include original medical reports or letters that are relevant - they’ll be returned to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jobcentre Plus will tell you if you need a reassessment meeting - you must go.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If your reassessment shows you’re capable of working, your Incapacity Benefit will stop.

Your UK National Insurance contributions may help you qualify for local benefits depending on the country.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/international-pension-centre\">Contact the International Pension Centre</a> to ask about receiving UK benefits while abroad.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"moving-back-to-the-uk\">Moving back to the UK</h3>\n\n<p>You may qualify for Incapacity Benefit if you now live in the UK but worked in a Social Security Agreement country for a UK employer. Some Social Security Agreement countries will pay Incapacity Benefit to you if you lived and worked there but now live in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Contact the relevant authorities in other countries directly to claim benefit from them.</p>\n\n",
