You can request it sooner if there’s a major change to the home (for example, repairs or improvements).</p>\n\n<p>Fill in the <a href=\"/government/publications/fair-rent-forms\">fair rent review form</a> and send it to the address on the form.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"if-your-rent-increases\">If your rent increases</h3>\n\n<p>Your landlord must serve you a notice of increase of rent in writing.
