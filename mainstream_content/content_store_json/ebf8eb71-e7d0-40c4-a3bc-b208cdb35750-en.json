Contact your pension provider if you’re not sure when you can take your pension.</p>\n\n<p>You can usually take up to 25% of the amount built up in any pension as a tax-free lump sum. This is limited to a maximum of 25% of your available lifetime allowance. For most individuals, the standard lifetime allowance applies. This is currently £1,073,100.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll then have 6 months to start taking the remaining 75%, which you’ll usually <a href=\"/tax-on-pension\">pay tax</a> on.</p>\n\n<p>If you hold lifetime allowance protection, this may <a href=\"/guidance/taking-higher-tax-free-lump-sums-with-lifetime-allowance-protection\">increase the amount of tax-free lump sum</a> you can take from your pensions.</p>\n\n<p>The options you have for taking the rest of your pension pot include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>taking all or some of it as cash</li>\n  <li>buying a product that gives you a guaranteed income (sometimes known as an ‘annuity’) for life</li>\n  <li>investing it to get a regular, adjustable income (sometimes known as ‘flexi-access drawdown’)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ask your pension provider which options they offer (they may not offer all of them).
