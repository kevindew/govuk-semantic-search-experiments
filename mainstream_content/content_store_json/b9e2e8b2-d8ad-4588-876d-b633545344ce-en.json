It does not matter how many countries you visit.

Add this number to the number of days you worked out in step 3.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check that the total number of days is not more than 90.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"travelling-to-eu-countries-that-are-not-in-the-schengen-area\">Travelling to EU countries that are not in the Schengen area</h2>\n\n<p>Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania are not in the Schengen area.
