There is no specific number of hours that makes someone full or part-time, but a full-time worker will usually work 35 hours or more a week.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Part-time workers should get the same treatment for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"/understanding-your-pay\">pay rates</a> (including sick pay, maternity, paternity and adoption leave and pay)</li>\n  <li>pension opportunities and benefits</li>\n  <li><a href=\"/holiday-entitlement-rights\">holidays</a></li>\n  <li>training and career development</li>\n  <li>selection for promotion and transfer, or for <a href=\"/redundant-your-rights\">redundancy</a>\n</li>\n  <li>opportunities for career breaks</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some benefits are applied ‘pro rata’ (in proportion to hours worked). For example, if a full-time worker gets a £1,000 Christmas bonus, and a part-time worker works half the number of hours, they should get £500.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>Overtime pay - part-time workers may not get <a href=\"/overtime-your-rights\">overtime pay</a> until they’ve worked over the normal hours of a full-time worker.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"when-employers-can-treat-part-time-workers-differently\">When employers can treat part-time workers differently</h2>\n<p>There are some situations when employers do not have to treat part-time workers in the same way as full-time employees. In these situations the employer must be able to show there is a good reason to do so - this is called ‘objective justification’.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n\n<p>An employer may provide health insurance for full-time employees but not part-timers if this can be objectively justified.</p>\n\n<p>Their reason may be that the costs involved are disproportionate to the benefits part-timers are entitled to.</p>\n\n<p>In this case the employer may come up with an alternative like asking the part-time worker to make a contribution to the extra cost.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-a-part-time-workers-been-treated-less-favourably\">If a part-time worker’s been treated less favourably</h2>\n\n<p>Part-time workers should first discuss this with their employer or trade union representative.</p>\n\n<p>They have the right to get a written statement of reasons for the treatment from their employer. The request should be in writing and the employer must write back within 21 days.</p>\n\n<p>If the worker is not satisfied that the reason given was objectively justified, they may be able to take a case to an <a href=\"/employment-tribunals\">employment tribunal.</a></p>\n",
