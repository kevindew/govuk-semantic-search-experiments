    "body": "<p>Employers using recruitment agencies to find temporary or permanent workers have certain responsibilities.</p>\n\n<p>Recruitment agencies that find staff for other businesses, but pay the staff themselves, are known as ‘employment businesses’.</p>\n\n<p>If you take on workers through an employment business, they’re responsible for ensuring the workers’ rights under <a href=\"/maximum-weekly-working-hours\">working time</a> and <a href=\"/national-minimum-wage/who-gets-the-minimum-wage\">minimum wage</a> rules.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>Recruitment agencies providing workers for agriculture, food processing, horticultural and shellfish-gathering industries are known as ‘gangmasters’ - if you use one, you need to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.gla.gov.uk/\">make sure they are licensed gangmasters</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"employers-responsibilities\">Employers’ responsibilities</h2>\n\n<p>As an employer, you’re responsible for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>agency workers’ <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/toolbox/workers/temporary.htm\">health and safety</a>\n</li>\n  <li>ensuring they have the same access to shared facilities as other workers</li>\n  <li>letting them know about relevant job vacancies in your business</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However, you can stop providing work to an agency worker, as long as they’re not employed by you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"additional-rights-after-12-weeks\">Additional rights after 12 weeks</h3>\n\n<p>After 12 weeks in the same job, agency workers are entitled to the same terms and conditions as employees doing the same or similar work. This includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>pay</li>\n  <li>working time, rest periods and breaks</li>\n  <li>night work</li>\n  <li>annual leave</li>\n  <li>time off for antenatal appointments for pregnant workers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more details, see <a href=\"/government/publications/agency-workers-regulations-2010-guidance-for-recruiters\">guidance on agency worker regulations</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transfer-fees\">Transfer fees</h2>\n\n<p>Recruitment agencies can charge a transfer fee if you employ a worker directly, or a worker is supplied to you through another recruitment agency after their initial contract. Recruitment agencies must tell you in your contract if they intend to charge you transfer fees.</p>\n\n<p>When an agency worker begins work with you, a recruitment agency can only charge a transfer fee if you take the worker on within either of the following periods, whichever ends later:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>8 weeks of the end of their last assignment with you</li>\n  <li>14 weeks of the start of their first assignment with you</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If there has been a break of 42 days between the worker’s assignments with you, the 14 weeks will begin from the start date of the most recent assignment.</p>\n\n<p>The recruitment agency may also charge you a transfer fee if:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you introduce a worker to a third party who then employs them during this period</li>\n  <li>you employ a worker introduced to you by a recruitment agency before they have started their assignment with you through the agency</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"extended-hire-period\">Extended hire period</h3>\n\n<p>If you employ a worker supplied to you by a recruitment agency, the agency must offer you an extended hire period instead of charging you a transfer fee. This means they would continue to supply the worker to you for an agreed period without changing the terms of the assignment. Once the agreed period ends, you would employ the worker directly without any transfer fee.</p>\n\n<p>A recruitment agency may charge you a transfer fee if they introduce a worker to you and you employ them:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>before they start work through the recruitment agency</li>\n  <li>through a different agency, before they start work through the introducing recruitment agency</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In both cases, the introducing agency must offer the option of a hire period instead of charging you a transfer fee. The terms of this hire period must be set out in your contract with the recruitment agency.</p>\n\n<p>If a recruitment agency does not offer you an extended hire period where you wish to take on the worker, they cannot charge you a transfer fee.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"get-advice-or-make-a-complaint\">Get advice or make a complaint</h2>\n\n<p>Contact the Employment Agency Standard (<abbr title=\"Employment Standards Agency\">EAS</abbr>) Inspectorate, the state regulator of private recruitment agencies.</p>\n\n<div class=\"contact\">\n<p>Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:eas@beis.gov.uk\">eas@beis.gov.uk</a><br>\nTelephone: 020 7215 4477<br>\n<a href=\"/call-charges\">Find out about call charges</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>You can also contact the <a href=\"/pay-and-work-rights\">Acas helpline</a>.</p>\n\n",
