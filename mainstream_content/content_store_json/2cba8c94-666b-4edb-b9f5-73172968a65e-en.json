You should call the <a href=\"/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/income-tax-enquiries-for-individuals-pensioners-and-employees#marriage-allowance\">Income Tax helpline</a> instead if you receive other income such as dividends, savings or benefits from your job. You can also call if you do not know what your taxable income is.</p>\n\n<p>When you transfer some of your Personal Allowance to your husband, wife or civil partner you might have to pay more tax yourself, but you could still pay less as a couple.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n\n<p>Your income is £11,500 and your Personal Allowance is £12,570, so you do not pay tax.</p>\n\n<p>Your partner’s income is £20,000 and their Personal Allowance is £12,570, so they pay tax on £7,430 (their ‘taxable income’). This means as a couple you are paying Income Tax on £7,430.</p>\n\n<p>When you claim Marriage Allowance you transfer £1,260 of your Personal Allowance to your partner. Your Personal Allowance becomes £11,310 and your partner gets a ‘tax credit’ on £1,260 of their taxable income.</p>\n\n<p>This means you will now pay tax on £190, but your partner will only pay tax on £6,170.
