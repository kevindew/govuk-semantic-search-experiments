They may be simply done by a show of hands at a meeting. Ordinary resolutions are used for most routine changes, for example, increasing a company’s share capital.</p>\n\n<p>Some decisions, for example changing your articles, might require a 75% or even 95% majority (called a ‘special resolution’ or ‘extraordinary resolution’).</p>\n\n<p>Your <a href=\"/limited-company-formation/memorandum-and-articles-of-association\">company articles</a> will usually tell you if you need a resolution, and what type it should be.</p>\n\n<p>You must let your shareholders (and auditors if relevant) know when there’s going to be a vote on a resolution.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>You must file special or extraordinary resolutions with Companies House within 15 days of passing them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"shareholder-voting-for-special-and-extraordinary-resolutions\">Shareholder voting for special and extraordinary resolutions</h2>\n\n<p>When you’re working out the majority in special or extraordinary resolutions you count the number of shares that give the owner the right to vote, rather than the number of shareholders.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n\n<p>A company has 100 shares and 3 shareholders.
