    "body": "<p>Universal Credit is a monthly payment to help with your living costs. You may be able to get it if you’re on a low income, out of work or you cannot work.</p>\n\n<p>Find out if you’re <a href=\"/universal-credit/eligibility\">eligible for Universal Credit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you live in Northern Ireland, go to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/universalcredit\">Universal Credit in Northern Ireland</a>.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>This guide is also available <a href=\"/hunangyflogaeth-a-chredyd-cynhwysol\">in Welsh (Cymraeg)</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"/universal-credit/how-to-claim\">Apply for Universal Credit</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"reporting-your-income-and-expenses\">Reporting your income and expenses</h2>\n\n<p>At the end of each monthly assessment period, you’ll need to report:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>how much you earned from self-employment, even if it’s nothing</li>\n  <li>any money you paid into a pension</li>\n  <li>payments into and out of your business</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This also applies to company directors, even those paying themselves by PAYE.</p>\n\n<p>Do this by completing the ‘Report your income and expenses’ section in your online Universal Credit account.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"payments-into-and-out-of-your-business\">Payments into and out of your business</h3>\n\n<p>You’ll need to report payments into and out of your business in each monthly assessment period. This includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the total amount your business received</li>\n  <li>how much your business spent on different types of expenses, such as travel costs, stock, equipment and tools, protective clothing and office costs</li>\n  <li>how much tax and National Insurance your business paid</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There’s more <a href=\"/government/publications/universal-credit-and-self-employment-quick-guide/how-to-report-your-earnings-from-self-employment\">guidance about reporting your income and expenses from self-employment</a>, which includes how to work out your income and the expenses you can include.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"your-businesss-property\">Your business’s property</h3>\n\n<p>You do not need to report things your company already owns (‘business assets’), such as machinery, buildings or cash in your company account.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"showing-that-self-employment-is-your-main-work\">Showing that self-employment is your main work</h2>\n\n<p>To claim Universal Credit if you’re self-employed, you need to show that self-employment is your main work.</p>\n\n<p>This includes showing that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>self-employment is your main job or your main source of income</li>\n  <li>you get regular work from self-employment</li>\n  <li>your work is organised - this means you have invoices and receipts, or accounts</li>\n  <li>you expect to make a profit</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Do this by giving your work coach evidence of your:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>tax returns, accounts and any business plan</li>\n  <li>Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR), if you’re registered for Self Assessment</li>\n  <li>customer and supplier lists, receipts and invoices</li>\n  <li>marketing materials</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you can show all these things, you’ll be considered ‘gainfully self-employed’. This means you do not have to look for other work and can concentrate on growing your business.</p>\n\n<p>If you cannot show all these things, you might have to look for other work if you want to keep getting Universal Credit.</p>\n\n<p>This depends on your circumstances - you’ll agree this when you meet your work coach.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-your-universal-credit-payment-is-worked-out\">How your Universal Credit payment is worked out</h2>\n\n<p>Your Universal Credit payment will be based on the earnings you report at the end of each monthly assessment period.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re gainfully self-employed, your Universal Credit payment may be calculated using an assumed level of earnings, called a minimum income floor.</p>\n\n<p>It’s based on what an employed person on minimum wage would expect to earn in similar circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>If you earn more than this, then your Universal Credit amount is based on your actual earnings.</p>\n\n<p>If you earn less, the minimum income floor is used to work out how much you can get. You may need to look for additional work to top up your income.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-youre-both-self-employed-and-employed\">If you’re both self-employed and employed</h2>\n\n<p>Your Universal Credit payment will be calculated based on your combined earnings from self-employment and employment.</p>\n\n<p>If you make a loss from self-employment, only your employment earnings will be used to calculate how much Universal Credit you get.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"get-a-start-up-period\">Get a start up period</h2>\n\n<p>You may be eligible for a 12 month start up period if you’re self-employed. Your work coach can tell you if you can get a start up period for your business.</p>\n\n<p>During your start up period your monthly earnings are used to work out your Universal Credit and the minimum income floor does not apply. You’ll also receive support from a work coach who’s trained to work with the self-employed.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll need to attend quarterly appointments with your work coach, providing evidence to show that you’re still gainfully self-employed and actively taking steps to build your business.</p>\n\n<p>You’re only entitled to one start up period, unless it has been more than 5 years since your previous one, and you’ve started a completely different type of self-employment.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"reporting-changes-in-your-circumstances\">Reporting changes in your circumstances</h2>\n\n<p>You’ll need to report any change in circumstances, for example if you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>close your business</li>\n  <li>start a different kind of business</li>\n  <li>take a permanent job</li>\n  <li>are no longer able to work</li>\n</ul>\n",
