They can hear cases in the criminal court, the family court, or both.</p>\n\n<p>Each case is usually heard by 3 magistrates, including a magistrate who is trained to act as a chairperson.</p>\n\n<p>A legal adviser in the court gives advice on the law and makes sure the magistrates follow the right procedures.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"criminal-cases\">Criminal cases</h2>\n\n<p>All criminal cases begin in a magistrates’ court.</p>\n\n<p>Magistrates pass the most serious crimes (for example murder, rape and robbery) to the Crown Court.
