Payments should show in your provider’s account within 24 hours, depending on their bank.</p>\n\n<p>As part of your application, you’ll find out if you’re eligible for Tax-Free Childcare. If you live in England, you’ll also find out if you’re eligible for 15 or 30 hours free childcare. You may find out straight away, but it can take up to 7 days.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-youre-employed-or-self-employed\">If you’re employed or self-employed</h2>\n\n<p>You’ll need your details (and your partner’s, if you have one), including your:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>National Insurance number</li>\n  <li>Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR), if you’re self-employed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You’ll also need:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the UK birth certificate reference number (if you have one) of any children you’re applying for</li>\n  <li>the date you started or are due to start work (this can be approximate if more than 3 months ago)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"if-youre-a-director\">If you’re a director</h2>\n\n<p>You’ll need to show you meet the <a href=\"/tax-free-childcare\">minimum income requirements</a> to be eligible. HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr>) will try to check this using your PAYE records.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not submit regular PAYE information, you may have to provide evidence to show you are working and expect to meet the minimum income requirements for the next 3 months. This could be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>wage slips</li>\n  <li>bank statements</li>\n  <li>a statement from your accountant</li>\n  <li>copies of invoices</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you’re not paid regularly (for example, once a year) you may need to send other evidence to show you’ll meet the minimum income requirements, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>annual wage slips</li>\n  <li>year end payroll</li>\n  <li>a letter from your tax agent or adviser confirming your salary has been paid and taxed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You’ll need to do this the first time you apply, and every time you reconfirm your eligibility.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"apply-for-a-childcare-account\">Apply for a childcare account</h2>\n\n<p>It takes 20 minutes to apply.</p>\n\n",
