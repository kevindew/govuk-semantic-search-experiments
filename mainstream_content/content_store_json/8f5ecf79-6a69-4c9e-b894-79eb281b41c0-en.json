However, if you apply years after the wedding, you might be asked to explain the delay.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll need to show that the marriage:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>was never legally valid (‘void’)</li>\n  <li>was legally valid, but meets one of the reasons that makes it ‘voidable’</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"your-marriage-is-not-legally-valid---void-marriages\">Your marriage is not legally valid - ‘void’ marriages</h2>\n\n<p>You can annul a marriage if it was not legally valid in the first place, for example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you’re closely related to the person you married</li>\n  <li>one or both of you were under 18 (or under 16 if the marriage took place before 27 February 2023)</li>\n  <li>one of you was already married or in a civil partnership</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If a marriage was never legally valid, the law says that it never existed.</p>\n\n<p>However, you may need legal paperwork (a ‘decree of nullity’ or ‘nullity of marriage order’) to prove this - for example if you want to get married again.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"your-marriage-is-voidable\">Your marriage is ‘voidable’</h2>\n\n<p>You can annul a marriage for a number of reasons, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>it was not consummated - you have not had sexual intercourse with the person you married since the wedding (does not apply for same sex couples)</li>\n  <li>you did not properly consent to the marriage - for example you were forced into it</li>\n  <li>the other person had a sexually transmitted disease (<abbr title=\"sexually transmitted disease\">STD</abbr>) when you got married</li>\n  <li>your spouse was pregnant by someone else when you got married</li>\n  <li>one spouse is in the process of <a href=\"/apply-gender-recognition-certificate\">transitioning to a different gender</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As with divorce, your marriage legally exists until you annul it using one of these reasons.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>The rules on <a href=\"/end-civil-partnership\">ending a civil partnership</a> are slightly different, but the court forms are the same.</p>\n</div>\n\n",
