However, public-sector employees get similar protection. Find out more about <a href=\"/government/publications/staff-transfers-in-the-public-sector\">staff transfers in the public sector</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"business-transfers\">Business transfers</h3>\n<p>This is where a business or part of a business moves from one employer to another. This can include mergers where 2 companies close and combine to form a new one.</p>\n\n<p>The identity of the employer must change, to be protected under <abbr title=\"Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)\">TUPE</abbr> during a business transfer.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"service-provision-changes\">Service provision changes</h3>\n\n<p>This is when:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a service provided in-house (for example cleaning, workplace catering) is awarded to a contractor</li>\n  <li>a contract ends and is given to a new contractor</li>\n  <li>a contract ends and the work is transferred in-house by the former customer</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Employees are not protected under <abbr title=\"Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)\">TUPE</abbr> if the contract is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>for the supply of goods for the company’s use (for example a restaurant changing food suppliers)</li>\n  <li>for a single event or short-term task (for example a catering company being used for a large corporate event)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Only the employees who can be clearly identified as providing the service being transferred are protected.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n<p>Example</p>\n\n<p>A courier collects and delivers for a business, but the packages are picked up or delivered by a number of different couriers on an ad hoc basis.
