See the <a href=\"/expenses-and-benefits-homeworking\">homeworking</a> guide for more information.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"salary-sacrifice-arrangements\">Salary sacrifice arrangements</h2>\n\n<p>If you provide office and workshop equipment and supplies as part of a salary sacrifice arrangement it won’t be exempt. You’ll need to report on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/reporting-and-paying\">form P11D</a> whichever amount is higher:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the salary given up</li>\n  <li>how much you paid for the office and workshop equipment and supplies</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These rules don’t apply to arrangements made before 6 April 2017 - check <a href=\"/guidance/salary-sacrifice-and-the-effects-on-paye\">when the rules will change</a>.</p>\n",
