  "description": "Employer and employee guide to unpaid carer’s leave - who can take it, how long for, when can employers postpone or delay.",
  "details": {
    "body": "<p>From 6 April 2024, employees will be entitled to unpaid leave to give or arrange care for a ‘dependant’ who has:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a physical or mental illness or injury that means they’re expected to need care for more than 3 months</li>\n  <li>a disability (as <a href=\"/definition-of-disability-under-equality-act-2010\">defined in the Equality Act 2010</a>)</li>\n  <li>care needs because of their old age</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The dependant does not have to be a family member. It can be anyone who relies on them for care.</p>\n\n<p>Employees are entitled to carer’s leave from their first day of work for their employer. Their <a href=\"/employee-rights-when-on-leave\">employment rights</a> (like holidays and returning to their job) are protected during carer’s leave.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-long-employees-can-take\">How long employees can take</h2>\n\n<p>Employees can take up to one week of leave every 12 months. A ‘week’ means the length of time they usually work over 7 days. For example, if someone usually works 3 days a week, they can take 3 days of carer’s leave.</p>\n\n<p>They can either take a whole week off or take individual days or half days throughout the year.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>If an employee needs to care for more than one person, they cannot take a week of carer’s leave for each dependant. They can only take one week every 12 months. They can use the week of leave on more than one dependant.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>If an employee is a parent, they can take up to 18 weeks’ <a href=\"/parental-leave\">leave to look after their child</a>. This is separate to carer’s leave.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"employees-with-irregular-working-patterns\">Employees with irregular working patterns</h3>\n\n<p>Work out how much carer’s leave the employee can take if their working hours change each week.</p>\n\n<ol class=\"steps\">\n<li>\n<p>Add up the total number of hours worked in the previous 12 months.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Divide that total by 52 (or however many weeks since they started the job, if they’ve been in the job less than a year).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is the amount of leave they can take as carer’s leave. </p>\n\n<p>If an employee wants to take carer’s leave in their first week, use the amount they’re expected to work in a week as the amount of leave they can take.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-take-carers-leave\">How to take carer’s leave</h2>\n\n<p>Employees need to give their employer notice before they want their leave to start. </p>\n\n<p>If the request is for half a day or a day, the notice period must be at least 3 days.</p>\n\n<p>If the request is for more than one day, the notice period must be at least twice as long as the requested leave. For example, if the request is for 2 days, the notice period must be at least 4 days.</p>\n\n<p>The notice period needs to be in full days, even if the request includes half day amounts.</p>\n\n<p>The request does not have to be in writing.</p>\n\n<p>Employees do not need to give evidence of their dependant’s care needs.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>If you need to <a href=\"/time-off-for-dependants\">look after someone in an emergency</a>, you can take time off for this without giving a notice period. </p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"when-employers-can-delay-carers-leave\">When employers can delay carer’s leave</h2>\n\n<p>Employers cannot refuse a carer’s leave request but can ask the employee to take it at a different time. They can only do this if the employee’s absence would cause serious disruption to the organisation.</p>\n\n<p>If they delay it, the employer must:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>agree another date within one month of the requested date for the leave</li>\n  <li>put the reason for the delay and new date in writing to the employee within 7 days of the original request, and before the requested start date of the leave</li>\n</ul>\n",
