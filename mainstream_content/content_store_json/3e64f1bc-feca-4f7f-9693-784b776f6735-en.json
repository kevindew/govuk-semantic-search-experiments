    "body": "<p>Some Post Offices can check your passport application - called ‘Check and Send’. It’s less likely that your application will be rejected if you use Check and Send.</p>\n\n<p>Look up a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.postoffice.co.uk/branch-finder\">Post Office that offers the Check and Send service</a>. From the drop down list, choose:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>‘Passport Check and Send - digital’ if you want Post Office staff to take your photo and help you fill out your application online</li>\n  <li>‘Passport Check and Send - paper’ if you’re applying with a paper form</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-much-it-costs\">How much it costs</h2>\n\n<p>Digital Check and Send includes the cost of the photo. It costs £16.00 on top of the <a href=\"/passport-fees\">passport application fee</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Paper Check and Send does not include the cost of the photo. It costs £16.00 on top of the passport application fee and the cost of your photos.</p>\n\n<p>The Check and Send service is free if you qualify for a free passport.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-pay\">How to pay</h3>\n\n<p>You can pay using:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>cash</li>\n  <li>credit or debit card</li>\n  <li>postal order (payable to ‘Post Office Limited’)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"getting-a-refund\">Getting a refund</h3>\n\n<p>You can only get a refund if HM Passport Office sends you a letter to say that the Post Office made a mistake with your application. The letter will tell you how you can ask the Post Office for a refund.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot get a refund if your application is rejected.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"making-a-digital-application\">Making a digital application</h2>\n\n<p>The Post Office will take your photo and help you to fill in your application online. What you need to bring depends on what type of application you’re making.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"if-youre-renewing-or-replacing-a-passport\">If you’re renewing or replacing a passport</h3>\n\n<p>You must bring your old passport to the Post Office if you still have it.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve changed your name, you’ll also need to bring proof of your new name (like a marriage certificate).</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>If your passport is lost, you’ll also need the name and email address of someone who can confirm your identity.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"if-youre-applying-for-your-first-adult-passport\">If you’re applying for your first adult passport</h3>\n\n<p>You will need to give the email address of someone who can confirm your identity.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll also need your parents’ details, including their:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>names, dates and places of birth</li>\n  <li>nationality</li>\n  <li>UK passport details, if they have them</li>\n  <li>details of their marriage or civil partnership, if they had one</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"if-youre-applying-for-someone-under-16\">If you’re applying for someone under 16</h3>\n\n<p>You’ll need to give both of their parents’ details, including their:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>names, dates and places of birth</li>\n  <li>nationality</li>\n  <li>UK passport details, if they have them</li>\n  <li>details of their marriage or civil partnership, if they had one</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you cannot provide both parent’s details, you need to say why (for example, you’re the only parent named on the birth certificate or you adopted the child on your own).</p>\n\n<p>You’ll also need the email address of someone who can confirm the child’s identity unless you’re renewing a passport for a child who is 12 or over and you have the child’s old passport with you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-happens-next\">What happens next</h3>\n\n<p>You’ll get email and text updates from HM Passport Office at each stage of the application process, and you can track it online.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Information\" class=\"application-notice info-notice\">\n<p>Using the Check and Send service does not guarantee your passport application will be successful.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"making-a-paper-application\">Making a paper application</h2>\n\n<p>You should take your completed paper application form, photos and any supporting documents to the Post Office.</p>\n\n<p>The Post Office Check and Send service will check you’ve:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>filled in the right sections of the paper form</li>\n  <li>got the right supporting documents (including photos)</li>\n  <li>paid the right fee</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>They will send your application to HM Passport Office by Special Delivery.</p>\n\n<p>Using Check and Send is usually faster than posting your own application. HM Passport Office may still need to contact either you or your countersignatory to check details.</p>\n\n",
